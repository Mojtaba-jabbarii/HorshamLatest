	BEnchmarking and models
		RE-run Benchmarking
		Observations:
		Hybrid:
			large416 , misalignment with FRT oscillation --> test slightly differnt voltage to fix.
		BESS only - PV on
			large707, misalignment due to BESS entering FRT in PSCAd and not in PSSE
			large710,  slight discrepancy
			large719 PSCAD oscillation
		BESS only - PV off: All cases quite shitty!
			723 Reactive power initialisation misaligned
			727 completely bonkers.
			728 bad misalignment.
			
		
		
			SMALL978 and small 979 --> change available power by more.
			1178, 1179 --> alignment issue on active and reactive power slope in frequency test, PSCAD much more aggressive.
			1188, 1189 --> Power factor steps yield no results.
			1192, 1193 --> not active power change steps happening. Just flat run essentially.,
			-->RERUN with lots of updates in 1184-1199			
			
			1200-1201 --> horrible alignment in BESS only case. It seems that PSCAD only issues commands to BESS, whereas PSS/E still tries to use PV. Setting change may be reuqired. Also alignment mismatch.
				PSSE initialises at -5 MVAr where it shoudl be -0 MVAr. Maybe PV being off impacts the power base or something? 
				There still appear to be a ""Qcmd to PV"" despite Operating mode set to 2.
			1210 PSS/E instability.
			1224 --> Nothing seems right. Misaligned in all signals.
			
			PSS/E seems off.	

		PRIORITY CASES: 
			large727: BESS only FRT, with trip in PSSE, completely different current injection etc.
			large728: BESS only FRT, significant discrepancy in fault response.
			small 1224: Plant not following POC level setpoints. Also 1 MVAr deviation.
			small 1210: vastly differnt frequency control response. Leading to Q deviation as well
			
		NOTES:
			WHY THE FUCK is FRT gradient in PV inverter set to 6 in PSSE but 2.0 in PSCAD? This seems to be a change from previous submission. --> are there any other differences? --> Dao said this was needed for stability. 
			
		check BESS-only cases alignment
		raise with SMA if required.	
		
		work through Model remarks tab and make 100% sure there are no lingering issues in models.
		
		add BESS-only cases to GPS testing.
			double-check if Dao's current injection was from PSSE or PSCAD
			run S5.2.5.5 current injection assessment for S5.2.5.5 only cases.
			all other cases
			add selection of S5.2.5.5 cases in PSSE as well.
			
		update documentation
			Finalis BM report update incl. all formatting an
			Finalise DMAT report (incl. improved graph formatting)
			Appendices for CS report
			
		
		
		
	DMAT:
		(re-run existing scope and reproduce report to see if model is still set up to achieve results from Dao.)
		check if any DMAT cases need to be added to to the test list as per issues tracker (e.g. BESS only case)
		adjust x-axis in plot script and reproduce final report.
		add BESS-only cases 
		
	Tuesday: raise all issues with Rosalie AND APPLY MAXIMUM PRESSURE!
	
		
	models:
		All items from issues tracker
		correct PSCAD label
