1) Scale on LV power input wrong --> probably fixed
2) small38, Q-setpoint test: Model does not initialise for P1 Q0 (small 38, 39) --> CRITICAL
3) small44: Active power setpoint signal not correctly scaled (small 44)
4) small46: active power and reactive power dents, presumably due to BESS inertia (small46) --> Recently not seeing anymore. Not spiking like that. Reduce frequency control delay? Maybe not. Could reduce inertia (gain).
5) voltage plot scale needs to be increased for minrange of 0.2pu or 0.1pu or something.
6) small65: BESS does not appear to be participating in frequency control response, only inertial contribution (small65 and other frequency tests) --> need t osee what 5.2.5.11 looks like. --> MEDIUM
	PPC prioritises the PV inverter response and Pmax is already hit at POC.

7) small83: FRT oscillation issue, PV inverters oscillate in and out of HVRT, PPC enters HVRT --> CRITICAL
small84: HVRT is entered, Active Power spike
		Look at TAP changer settings in Sepoint list!
		Diverging active power setpoints: Seen on Summerville with high Inertia constant. Not sure if applicable.
		Might be linked to FRT of PV: Maybe some extreme windup for no reason?
		
		
8) small 101: large active power increase after LVRT, oscillation in active power. --> CRITICAL
	Looks like active powdr control misbehaves. Gain too high??
	Workaround: FRT stop delay increase to 0.3??
	
small 106: PV LVRT activation --> Double-check tap changer setting. 
9) small107: ACTIVE POWER COMMANDS DRIFT --> CRITICAL
	seems again linked to FRT. Not sure why.
	Could consider dropping voltage more so that the voltage at POC is to 0.85
	
9.5) small109: vertical step in P command for some reason.	

10) large 85 and following: active power noise, increase minrange on active power to 60?
11) large127: any concerns with reactive power magnitude? Some noise
12) large 139 active power slope, medium priority
13) Large 347, 353: ABSOLUTE DISASTER, GOES IN HVRT AND GETS STUCK?? LOOKS LIKE MAYBE SIMULATION CRASHED
	ISSUE IN PLOT SCRIPT> -0st-fault SCR=1, not 90.
14) large365: Reactive power response weird --> MINOR
	BESS not in FRT. --> can this be configured? Voltage inertia acting.
15) large368:  Reactive power overshoot post-fault. --> LOW/MINOR (might be able to work with scaling)
16) TOV 7 and 10: Reactive Power Undershoot --> INstantaneous voltage decrease causes Q of PV inverters to drop and "voltage inertia" of BESS causes another part of the spike.

INIT RUN
small1031 (setpoint 2) voltage at POC too high --> is it the correct one? Also voltage at MV=1.064 --> WAY TOO HIGH.

small Pout_INV_BESSS of 0.35 corresponds to 60MW in case 1030 but in case 1080 Pout_INV_BESS of 0.39 only corresponds to 29 MW. 


ISSUES DMAT run 2: 
	-general: 
			it seems there is a difference in voltage control aggressiveness/base/Droop setting. maybe also impedance somewhere
			SCR post-fault wrong in plot script for cases where SCR changes after fault
	-small 14, small26: Q initialisation not aligned, reactive power steps smaller magnitude in PSS/E, slower slope in PSSE
	-small 44: difference in reactive power
	-small 45: difference in reactive power
	-small 46: difference in reactive power
	-small75: Q step size misalignment
	-small83 PSCAD FRT retriggering
	-small91: PSCAD complete instability
	-small98: BESS in PSS/E goes completely bonkers
	-small 101: active and reactive power misalignment durign fault 
	-small118: ANG profile does not apepar to be done at all in PSS/E
	-small137: slight misalignment, shoudl be easy to fix
	-large139 active power slope PSCAD during fault
	-large362 fault behaviour misalignment PSS/E PSCAD	
	-large365: active power and reactive power in PSS/E drifts after fault. Completely bonkers.
	-large368: reactive power overshoot after fault

Summary of parameter changes:

CONSIDERED CHANGES: 
	LVRT threshold	
	SUM dyr file for PV inverter and PPC? Updated BESS settings for SUM
	
	
NOTES:
	MV voltage range has to be within 1.025 to 1.035 for tap to be accurately set. This only allows for one possible tap changer setting
	


TO DO:
	small 63: Q initialisation PSSE --> scenario issue
	small91: plant never exits FRT. Ongoing oscillation in PSSE and PSCAD
	small92: weird Q response of BESS i in PSSE leading to strange recovery behaviour
	small101 active power overshoot post fault in PSSE
	
	instability: 
		0.5) DRPVOL of BESS --> reduce! If too low then will reacti too strongly, if too high it follows PPC commands closely but causes oscillation issue. default 0.05. was increase to 0.3. now 0.2. 
		1) test Summerville parameters for BESS inverters.
		2) test less aggressive droop setting (making PSS/E BESS more aggressive appears to have made issue appear in PSS/E). Try slower Ki constant for reactive Power control
		3) 20240505- 15:52 PSS/E model stable! --> Check parameter set in corresponding PSSE result folder and compare against current set.
		
	small101 - active power overshoot post fault. PPC out of FRT while. Exit delay increase. Maye tune LVRT exit of PV a bit tighter. PPC command reset threshold might be intervening. Try 0.5
		try smaller Ki? May cause issue with initialisation time
		check active power command debug channels earlier in the signal chain before limiter. PV out of LVRT earlier might resolve issue
