Debugging notes:
	1) test 1: 1210 with PoiPwrAtCtrlMode=2 and BatPwrAtCrsl.Ena=1 in HyCtlCfg4.ini and HSFBESS_SMIB_V1_BS.dyr; also FCASCont.ena=0
		
-intersting parameters: FrqUseBatPwr

For submission:
1) Update standalone BESS dyr files with SMA's latest fix
2) re-run dbg BM cases
	small 1200, reactive power control response misalignment (small 1210 slight misalignment remaining as well)
	small 1224, no active power response at all. Misalignment of 2 MVAr at initialisation. --> test this case with adjusting BESS setpoint instead of POC setpoint. Look at AutoMode as well and SMA explanation to see if this helps.
	
	large 707, Hybrid case, BESS not entering FRT.. --> LVRT entry woudl need to be slightly higher.. Would need to check that this does not affect alignment in other cases..
	large719 Hybrid case, slight instability in PSCAD response.
	
	large 727, BESS standalone case. BESS getting stuck in FRT in PSSE 
		--> check if decreasing hysteresis of FRT settings in BESS inverters fixes issue 
		--> 20% hysteresis is quite large. If changing settings, verify that no impact on Hybrid cases in Benchmarking and DMAT.
	large728, misalingmnet in FRT behaviour
	
	large 731, large 732 significant (!) misalignment in BESS inverter performance during FRT (BESS not in FRT, neither PSSE nor PSCAD)
	
	--> test if voltage control response difference is only in BESS standalone mode. Check if only during export or import or both
	--> test if FRT difference only in BESS or in Hybrid mode --> run batch with all BM FRT scenarios for comparison.
	
	
	
3) re-run updated Benchmarking for Hybrid and BESS standalone (full)

4) re-run DMAT for Hybrid case (add BESS only cases?)

5) re-scale and run BM again
6) run DMAT again

7) look at optimising S5.2.5.5 performance? --. Damo mentioned S5.2.5.4 problematic with more aggressive Iq gains...
	-double-check if PV inverters case problematic (re-test S5.2.5.5 PV-only cases for S5.2.5.4 and S5.2.5.5

8) update rest of GPS compliance scenarios

9) resctructure GPS to separate out BESS/Solar/Hybrid where applicable (clauses S5.2.5.1 and S5.2.5.5, maybe S5.2.5.11, as well as fault currents)
