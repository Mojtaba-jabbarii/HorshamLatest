Debugging notes:
	1) test 1: 1210 with PoiPwrAtCtrlMode=2 and BatPwrAtCrsl.Ena=1 in HyCtlCfg4.ini and HSFBESS_SMIB_V1_BS.dyr; also FCASCont.ena=0
		
-intersting parameters: FrqUseBatPwr

For submission:
1) Update standalone BESS dyr files with SMA's latest fix
2) re-run dbg BM cases
	small 1200, reactive power control response misalignment (small 1210 slight misalignment remaining as well)
	small 1224, no active power response at all. Misalignment of 2 MVAr at initialisation. --> test this case with adjusting BESS setpoint instead of POC setpoint. Look at AutoMode as well and SMA explanation to see if this helps.
	
	large 707, Hybrid case, BESS not entering FRT.. --> LVRT entry woudl need to be slightly higher.. Would need to check that this does not affect alignment in other cases..
	large719 Hybrid case, slight instability in PSCAD response.
	
	large 727, BESS standalone case. BESS getting stuck in FRT in PSSE 
		--> check if decreasing hysteresis of FRT settings in BESS inverters fixes issue 
		--> 20% hysteresis is quite large. If changing settings, verify that no impact on Hybrid cases in Benchmarking and DMAT.
	large728, misalingmnet in FRT behaviour
	
	large 731, large 732 significant (!) misalignment in BESS inverter performance during FRT (BESS not in FRT, neither PSSE nor PSCAD)
	
	--> test if voltage control response difference is only in BESS standalone mode. Check if only during export or import or both
	--> test if FRT difference only in BESS or in Hybrid mode --> run batch with all BM FRT scenarios for comparison.
	

20240930:
-re-run update BM for Hybrid and BESS standalone with original VarCtlVol settings
	727 and 737 look most problematic.732 still shows misalignment although quite improved.
	
-try with starting values from SMA guide for VarCtlVol settings instead. 
	often misalignment in terms of invertrs being in FRT in one software and not the other.
	
-re-run with settings in between previous varCtlVol settings and SMA starting values.

-re-run with slighly lowered LVRT exit setting for BESS inverter, allowing for 5% deadband
--> thought it looked good, however upon re-running, performance of PSS/E model seems to deteriorate without setting changes (large 763 looks bad although 726 is the same case)
	--> resetting compiler and re-running
	--> If still problematic, try with LVRT exit raised again.

-stil lproblematic. raise LVRT exit back.	
-large 765 - 776 looks extremely shit. 0.32 - 0.5 residual looks shit in both with higher and lower LVRT exxit., 


-If improved, run full DMAT with it in hybrid mode

-try and tackle remaining problematic cases by adjusting BESS FRT in PSSE

-re-scale
	-flag latest issues with SMA
	-test SUM corrected params
	-update inv numbers and TR rating
	-update test scenarios
	-run DMAT and BM over weekend in new config

-check Benchmarking to verify it still looks similar.

-run S5.2.5.5 and S5.2.5.4 
7) look at optimising S5.2.5.5 performance? --. Damo mentioned S5.2.5.4 problematic with more aggressive Iq gains...
	-double-check if PV inverters case problematic (re-test S5.2.5.5 PV-only cases for S5.2.5.4 and S5.2.5.5

-add missing scenarios
	DMAT
	GPS resctructure GPS to separate out BESS/Solar/Hybrid where applicable (clauses S5.2.5.1 and S5.2.5.5, maybe S5.2.5.11, as well as fault currents)
		Arguably S5.2.5.13, S5.2.5.2, S5.2.5.3, S5.2.5.8, and maybe S5.2.5.14  don't require separation.
	
-final run

-FRT tuning memo: If choosing oto aggressive VarCtlVol then misalignments PSSE PSCAD. If choosing too aggressive gains in PV inverters: Instability in S5.2.5.4.
