Debugging notes:
	1) test 1: 1210 with PoiPwrAtCtrlMode=2 and BatPwrAtCrsl.Ena=1 in HyCtlCfg4.ini and HSFBESS_SMIB_V1_BS.dyr; also FCASCont.ena=0
		
-intersting parameters: FrqUseBatPwr

For submission:
-Update standalone BESS dyr files with SMA's latest fix
-re-run updated Benchmarking for Hybrid and BESS standalone

-re-run DMAT for Hybrid case (add BESS only cases?)

-re-scale and run BM again
-run DMAT again

-look at optimising S5.2.5.5 performance? --. Damo mentioned S5.2.5.4 problematic with more aggressive Iq gains...
	-double-check if PV inverters case problematic (re-test S5.2.5.5 PV-only cases for S5.2.5.4 and S5.2.5.5

-update rest of GPS compliance scenarios

-resctructure GPS to separate out BESS/Solar/Hybrid where applicable (clauses S5.2.5.1 and S5.2.5.5, maybe S5.2.5.11, as well as fault currents)
